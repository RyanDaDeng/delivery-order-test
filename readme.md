## Description

The solution is written on Laravel framework.

## Installation

1. This is a Laravel composer package, you need to have a Laravel installed first.
2. Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require timehunter/delivery-order-test
```

## Usage

## Question Analysis

Potential design patterns can be used for this problem: factory, template method and strategy

The problem can be categorised as the following points:

1. How to create different objects based on dynamic input value? e.g. “enterpriseDelivery” return EnterpriseDelivery object
 - use Factory pattern which encapsulates the logic of creating objects.
 
2. Different object should contain its own workflow and dependent services.
 - use Strategy pattern(interface) or template method(inheritance)
 
3. Domain driven design
 - Basically make the system as module based and each module has its own services. If there are any common interfaces, they can be shared across different module.
 - From the question mentioned, I can see there are three modules can be found: Delivery Order module, Third party module and Marketing module


## My solution

1. I use Template Method design pattern which is based on inheritance. It allows me modify parts of an algorithm by extending those parts in sub-classes.
2. I also use factory pattern to determine which type of delivery order object I need to return.

 Note:
 
 1. As mentioned in the question, the EnterpriseDelivery Order needs to be validated with third party api first, if its failed, the logic should no longer continue.
 In this case, I have a defined steps in the abstract class, e.g. check validation first, then do the logic.
 
 ````php
 ....
     public function process()
     {
         if ($this->validate()) {
             $this->before();
             $this->handle();
             $this->after();
 
             return true;
         } else {
             return false;
         }
     }
....
 ````
 
 The handle function is an abstract function which will be implemented for all sub-classes. Use this function to define its own workflow.
 
 
## Usage

````php
 $json = "[{},{},{}...{}]"; // the given sample json data
 $service = new DeliveryOrderService($json);
 $objects = $service->processJson() // this return a list of different delivery order objects
 
 
````

## Testing

I. use PHPUnit
2. Mocking Interfaces for testing
3. Pass different json to test if the service returns the correct delivery type
4. use travis-ci for CI/CD
