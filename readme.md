## Description

The solution is written on Laravel framework.

## Installation

1. This is a Laravel composer package, you need to have a Laravel installed first.
2. Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require timehunter/delivery-order-test
```

## Usage

## Question Analysis

Potential design patterns can be used for this problem: factory, template method and strategy

The problem can be categorised as the following points:

1. How to create different objects based on dynamic input value? e.g. “enterpriseDelivery” return EnterpriseDelivery object
 - use Factory pattern which encapsulates the logic of creating objects.
 
2. Different object should contain its own workflow and dependent services.
 - use Strategy pattern(interface) or template method(inheritance)
 
3. Domain driven design
 - Basically make the system as module based and each module has its own services. If there are any common interfaces, they can be shared across different module.
 - From the question mentioned, I can see there are three modules can be found: Delivery Order module, Third party module and Marketing module


## My solution

#### Assumptions
1. Marketing service and Third Party api service have been fully tested.


#### Designs

1. I use Template Method design pattern which is based on inheritance. It allows me modify parts of an algorithm by extending those parts in sub-classes.
2. I also use factory pattern to determine which type of delivery order object I need to return.

 Note:
 
 1. As mentioned in the question, the EnterpriseDelivery Order needs to be validated with third party api first, if its failed, the logic should no longer continue.
 In this case, I have a defined steps in the abstract class, e.g. check validation first, then do the logic.
 
 ````php
 ....
     public function process()
     {
         if ($this->validate()) {
             $this->before();
             $this->handle();
             $this->after();
 
             return true;
         } else {
             return false;
         }
     }
....
 ````
 
 The handle function is an abstract function which will be implemented for all sub-classes. Use this function to define its own workflow.
 
 
## Usage

````php
 $json = "[{},{},{}...{}]"; // the given sample json data
 $service = new DeliveryOrderService($json);
 $objects = $service->processJson() // this return a list of different delivery order objects
 
 
````

## Testing

1. use PHPUnit
2. Mocking Interfaces for testing
3. Pass different json to test if the service returns the correct delivery type
4. use travis-ci for CI/CD: https://coveralls.io/github/RyanDaDeng/delivery-order-test?branch=master

## Improvements & Relecftions
1. The package does not use any Laravel feature e.g. service containers, facades. They can be applied by creating service provider to register their dependencies.
2. API service and marketing service can be singleton.
3. If any new delivery order type comes in, we just need to create a new sub-class which extends Abstract base class.
4. Strategy pattern can be used instead of inheritance if the interface and design are finalised.
